    "text": "Human Ethology is the official journal of The International Society for Human Ethology (ISHE). It is an online peer-reviewed journal publishing scholarly works within the broad tradition of ethology as applied to humans. Human Ethology is open-access (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) and does not charge authors a publication fee.\nISHE was founded in 1972 and was producing a newsletter for circulation to members soon thereafter. The Human Ethology Newsletter became the Human Ethology Bulletin in 1995 and started publishing peer-reviewed scholarly articles in 2012, when the journal also moved to an on-line format. The Human Ethology Bulletin was renamed Human Ethology in 2019 and continues the practice of publishing one volume per calendar year, utilising the flexibility of the on-line format to add articles as they are accepted.\nEthology has close ties to many other disciplines including behavioural ecology, evolutionary biology, physical anthropology, cultural anthropology, comparative psychology, developmental psychology, evolutionary psychology and linguistics.\nHuman Ethology publishes articles in all areas relating to the direct observation of human behaviour and that of closely related species, as well as work taking an approach consistent with Tinbergen’s four levels of explanation. Purely descriptive and inductive studies will also be considered as well as reviews, provided they are thorough and methodologically rigorous. The journal also welcomes submissions relating to the replication of earlier studies."
