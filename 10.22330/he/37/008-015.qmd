  Ethological observations in extreme living and working contexts are relevant for interdisciplinary investigations and methodological applications on human adaptation in experimental settings, as offered in The Scientific International Research in Unique Terrestrial Station (SIRIUS) program. Observational data collected from video recordings during the Moon mission crew's collective activities over a 120-day simulation (n=6, mixed gender and culture) produced ethological results according to mission days, major events and environmental factors. We reviewed key behavioral outcomes in such a context of occurrences and in extended periods of time. The emphasis is on Moon landing at mid-period with positive facial expressions and increased flow of merged behaviors as adaptive strategies. Analysis of the results in this brief report follows the original article on "individual diversity and temporal stability during a 4-month confinement experiment (SIRIUS-19) for human space exploration" (Tafforin et al., 2021).
